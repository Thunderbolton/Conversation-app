# [ Let's Talk About](https://thunderbolton.github.io/Conversation-app/ "Let's Talk About")


An interactive website allowing for conversation practice across a wide variety of topics. 



# Description
*Let's Talk About* is made up of around 100 small cards each labelled by topic that once expanded reveal a set of conversation questions related to that topic. Users can scroll the page to find something they would like to talk about, or can use a search bar to navigate to a specific topic. 

The inspiration for this project came during one of my online English classes where the conversation happened to hit a dead-end. I envisioned an approach that added direction to conversations, so I put that into code and created this site.
